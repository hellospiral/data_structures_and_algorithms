# Data structures and algorithms

Teaching myself classic CS101 material.

I'm learning the material in Python, writing solutions to the problems in Ruby, and then translating the answers from Python into Ruby. :)

## Curriculum to cover:

* Algorithm Analysis and Big O
* Array Sequences
* Stacks Queues and Deques
* Linked Lists
* Recursion
* Trees
* Searching and Sorting
* Graph Algorithms
